Although my manager already performs well in these areas, there may be opportunities to further strengthen Dive Deep, Learn and Be Curious, and Invent and Simplify to increase customer impact. As a newer SDE, I would benefit from even more visibility into deeper technical context and decision background, as well as additional knowledge-sharing opportunities within the team. Exploring small process or documentation simplifications could also improve team efficiency. These areas are already solid, and small enhancements could make them even more effective in amplifying customer outcomes.
